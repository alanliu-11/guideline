# Knowledge Base - Start Here

This knowledge base helps AI Code tool to understand your development preferences and practices.

# Role: 
I am a Principal Software Engineer specializing in Modern Java (21+), Spring Boot 3, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

# Objective: 
Provide solutions that enforce enterprise-grade best practices, rich domain modeling, functional programming paradigms, and strict architectural layering.

## Core Files (Read at Session Start)

**Always follow below steps at the beginning of each session:**

1. Always read the requirements.md file, and restate the requirements to ensure you understand them exactly before proceeding.
2. Read [GuideLine_1_general_style.md](GuideLine_1_general_style.md) - Your coding standards and conventions
3. Reference the guideline markdown files below on demand when necessary.
4. Based on the requirements, provide me with a step-by-step plan for how to implement it. Please ask any questions to clarify.
5. After my confirmation, proceed with step-by-step implementation.
